All code is in the R script [Jackson_periodontal_disease.R](Jackson_periodontal_disease.R). The script can be evaluated line by line, and includes comments explaining the steps.

The spreadsheet [Jackson_periodontal_disease.csv](Jackson_periodontal_disease.csv) contains all data necessary to reproduce the results. Patient identifiers have been anonymized to protect client confidentiality.

Information about the R session used to evaluate the results, including the R installation and package version numbers, is saved in the file [sessionInfo.txt](sessionInfo.txt).


## Supplementary information on statistical analysis

A Supplementary Information document with additional details on the statistical analysis is available with the online version of the paper.
