Code and data for Jackson et al. (2015) study on equine periodontal disease
=============================================================================

This repository contains R code and data to reproduce the statistical analysis in the Jackson et al. (2015) paper, titled *Retrospective study of the effectiveness of four different treatments of equine cheek teeth periodontal disease.*


## Contents

All code is in the R script [Jackson2015_periodontal_disease.R](Jackson2015_periodontal_disease.R). The script can be evaluated line by line and includes comments explaining the steps.

The spreadsheet [Jackson2015_periodontal_disease.csv](Jackson2015_periodontal_disease.csv) contains all data necessary to reproduce the results. Patient identifiers have been anonymized to protect client confidentiality.

The statistical methods and results are summarized in the Supplementary Information document, which will be published with the online version of the paper. A final author draft of the Supplementary Information is also available in the [drafts](drafts/) folder in this repository.

Information about the R session used to evaluate the results, including the R installation and package version numbers, is saved in the file [sessionInfo.txt](sessionInfo.txt).
