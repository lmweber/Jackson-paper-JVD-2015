This repository contains R code and data to reproduce the statistical analysis in our paper:

- Jackson K., Weber L. M., and Tennant M., *Retrospective study of the effectiveness of four different treatments of equine cheek teeth periodontal disease*, Journal of Veterinary Dentistry, forthcoming.


## Contents

All code is in the R script [Jackson_periodontal_disease.R](Jackson_periodontal_disease.R). The script can be evaluated line by line, and includes comments explaining the steps.

The spreadsheet [Jackson_periodontal_disease.csv](Jackson_periodontal_disease.csv) contains all data necessary to reproduce the results. Patient identifiers have been anonymized to protect client confidentiality.

Information about the R session used to evaluate the results, including the R installation and package version numbers, is saved in the file [sessionInfo.txt](sessionInfo.txt).
